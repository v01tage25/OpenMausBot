// A durable board of work, alongside the bots that do it.
//
// The delegation queue (delegations.ts) already tracks work that moves BETWEEN
// bots, but it is deliberately invisible: an item exists only as queued or
// drained, with no owner, no status, and no place on a screen. The team map
// shows who talks to whom, not who owes what. This module is the missing
// record — one row per piece of work, owned by one bot, carrying a status a
// person set and a link to the thread the work actually happens in.
//
// It is a PARALLEL record, never a replacement. A work item does not queue,
// drain, or dispatch anything: starting and stopping the bot stays on the
// routes that already own those paths (`POST /api/bots/:id/messages` and
// `/interrupt`). That keeps one implementation of "run a turn" in the app
// instead of two that can disagree.
